Book Recommendation System Using Realtime Speech Recognition and NLP
Overview
This project is a Book Recommendation System that recommends books based on audio recordings. The system utilizes real-time speech recognition to transcribe the spoken words and processes the transcribed text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It then generates book recommendations by calculating the similarity between the transcribed text and books in the dataset.

Tools and Technologies
Jupyter Notebook
Python

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Features
Real-time speech recognition: The system can transcribe audio recordings in real-time, making it convenient for users to get book recommendations based on spoken queries.

NLP Preprocessing: The transcribed text undergoes NLP preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and other NLP techniques to prepare it for similarity analysis.

Book Recommendation: The system uses machine learning and NLP techniques to calculate the similarity between the transcribed text and books in the dataset, providing book recommendations that are most relevant to the user's query.

How to Use
Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Requirements

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can use the following command to install them:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data

You'll need a dataset of books for the recommendation system. The dataset should include book titles, authors, and descriptions.

Real-time Speech Recognition

Implement or integrate a real-time speech recognition system that can capture audio and transcribe it into text. You can use existing libraries or APIs for this purpose.

NLP Preprocessing

Preprocess the transcribed text using NLP techniques to clean and tokenize the text. This step prepares the text for similarity analysis.

Book Recommendation System

Utilize machine learning and NLP to calculate the similarity between the preprocessed text and books in the dataset. Implement the recommendation system and display the recommended books to the user.
